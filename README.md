# Forecasting-Springtime-Frost-Risk
The code aims to forecast frost events during spring, which occur at night when the soil becomes warmer than the sky and consequently loses heat. As a result, plants can suffer damage caused by frost. This model attempts to predict such events by using the most recent temperature and relative humidity values recorded before sunset.
